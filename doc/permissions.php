@page permissions Setting Up Permissions

The Translation Memory module includes 2 new permissions which should be granted to any user that you want to have access to the translation form:

-# @code tm:get strings @endcode  - Permission to be able to load strings from the translation memory.
-# @code tm:add translation @endcode - Permission to be able to add translations to the translation memory.

It also makes use of the existing @p translate permission to limit access to the translate action entirely.
