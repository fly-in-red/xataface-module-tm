@page roadmap Road Map

@par 0.1

0.1 is an initial release that sets up the foundation for what is to come.  It provides the table structure and a translation form that automatically applies the translation memory - and updates it, but it doesn't fully implement the full potential of the module.

@par 0.2

-# Support for Partial Match Lookup
-# Support for Workflow/Approval Processes

@par Under construction

The full roadmap hasn't been mapped out completely.  It will be added to this page as it is developed though.
